Welcome to the world of fashion!!!

In this project, we have classified the fashion mnist dataset using various machine learning models like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor
, Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After hypertuning these models, we achieved the highest test accuracy of 91.5% on CNN.
