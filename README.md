Welcome to the world of fashion!!!

In this project, we have classified the fashion mnist dataset using various machine learning models like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor
, Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After hypertuning these models, we achieved the highest test accuracy of 91.5% on CNN.

To able to run our best model, use the main.py python file
To view the results of  other machine learning models, its hyper tuning process, activation and heat maps, dimenional reduction and other visualisation techniques performed on the dataset, please refer to fashion.ipynb file
